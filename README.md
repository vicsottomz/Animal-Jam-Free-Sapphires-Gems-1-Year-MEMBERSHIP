Animal Jam, the beloved multiplayer online game by WildWorks, continues to evolve with a series of significant updates and improvements aimed at enhancing player experience, expanding in-game economies, and introducing new features. With a global community of young players and families, Animal Jam‚Äôs mobile version remains a vibrant digital playground where creativity, education, and fun converge. This report explores the most recent updates, focusing on changes to Sapphires and Gems, membership adjustments, and the introduction and evolution of Wishing Coins.

Core Game Updates and General Improvements
Animal Jam has maintained a steady cadence of updates, with major releases in February, April, May, and June. Each update has brought new features, bug fixes, and content expansions. The June 2025 update, for example, was rolled out across all platforms, requiring players to ensure all their devices run the same version to maintain cross-device compatibility and social features. Notably, the update process is now more streamlined, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app is discouraged, as it does not expedite updates and can risk losing saved Masterpieces. These improvements reflect the developers‚Äô ongoing commitment to a seamless and secure gaming experience, with a particular focus on account safety and technical stability.

One noteworthy addition is the Security Station, an educational feature designed to help players understand best practices for keeping their accounts safe. This initiative is part of a broader effort to foster a safe online environment, especially given the game‚Äôs young audience. Alongside this, the developers have actively addressed known bugs and technical issues, ensuring that players on the latest version (as of June 2025, version 110.1.17) benefit from the most stable and feature-rich experience possible.

Updates in Sapphires and Gems
Gems: The Foundation of the In-Game Economy
Gems remain the basic currency in Animal Jam, used to purchase a wide array of accessories and den items. Players can earn Gems by participating in various minigames or by recycling unwanted items, making them accessible to all players regardless of membership status. The game continues to encourage recycling and gameplay participation as the primary means of accumulating Gems, reinforcing the value of active engagement within the community.

Sapphires: Premium Currency and Recent Changes
Sapphires, on the other hand, serve as the premium currency, enabling players to unlock new avatars, dens, pets, and exclusive items. Sapphires can be purchased directly through in-app purchases or earned through certain in-game achievements and events. Membership in Animal Jam Classic also grants daily Sapphires upon login, incentivizing continued engagement and rewarding loyalty.

A significant change  is the adjustment of Sapphire pricing and distribution, particularly in relation to membership. The cost of membership purchased with Sapphires increased from 400 to 600 Sapphires per month. This adjustment represents a substantial jump, especially for players who rely on Sapphires rather than direct monetary purchases to maintain their membership status. The change has sparked considerable discussion within the community, with some expressing concern over the increased difficulty in maintaining membership through in-game currency alone. Nevertheless, the developers have framed this adjustment as necessary to support ongoing game development and to maintain the quality of content and features provided to players.

Additionally, there are notable differences in Sapphire pricing depending on the platform used for purchases. Players have discovered that buying Sapphires and memberships through the Animal Jam website is significantly cheaper than through the mobile app, due to the avoidance of app store fees. For example, on PC, 1,000 Sapphires can cost around $8 USD, whereas in-app purchases are often bundled at higher rates. This disparity has led many players to recommend purchasing through the website whenever possible to maximize value.

Membership: Price Changes and Value
Price Increases and Community Response
One of the most impactful updates  has been the change in membership pricing. Starting March 1, the price of new Animal Jam membership subscriptions purchased through the app increased from $6.95 to $8.99 per month in the U.S., with similar increases in other regions. For memberships purchased with Sapphires, the cost rose from 400 to 600 Sapphires per month. Existing memberships and those purchased before March 1 were grandfathered in at the old rates, but all new subscriptions are subject to the updated pricing.

This price adjustment has generated mixed reactions within the Animal Jam community. While some players understand the need for price increases due to inflation and the rising costs of maintaining and developing a high-quality online game, others‚Äîparticularly younger players who rely on parental allowances‚Äîhave expressed frustration. The developers have responded by emphasizing their commitment to providing a fun, educational, and safe environment, and by highlighting the additional content and features made possible by membership fees.

Membership Benefits and Platform Differences
Membership in Animal Jam continues to offer a range of benefits, including daily Sapphires, access to exclusive animals, dens, and items, and special in-game features. The value proposition of membership remains strong, especially for dedicated players who wish to access the full breadth of content. However, as noted earlier, purchasing membership through the website rather than the app can result in significant savings and additional bonuses, such as larger Sapphire bundles with longer-term subscriptions.

Wishing Coins: New Mechanics and Mythical Pets
Introduction and Acquisition
Wishing Coins are a relatively new addition to Animal Jam‚Äôs in-game economy, introduced as part of the ongoing effort to expand gameplay variety and reward systems. These coins can be purchased from the Premium Shop by clicking on the Sapphire icon, or acquired by visiting the Wishing Well in Crystallis, a mystical area located under the statue of Zios in the Lost Temple of Zios. The Wishing Well mechanic is designed to introduce a new layer of excitement and collectibility, allowing players to wish for Mythical Pets with varying degrees of customization.

How Wishing Coins Work
Each wish at the Wishing Well uses between one and six Wishing Coins, depending on how specific the player wants to be about their desired pet‚Äôs colors and traits. A single coin grants a random Mythical Pet, while additional coins allow for greater control over the outcome. This system not only adds depth to the pet collection aspect of the game but also introduces an element of chance and strategy. Occasionally, players may receive Mythical Pets with rare traits, further incentivizing repeated participation in the Wishing Well feature.

Integration with Other Features
The introduction of Wishing Coins has been complemented by other features, such as the ability to exchange old Leilani coins for Leilani Points at the Leilani Coin Exchange station in Moku‚Äôahi. These points are now used in all trades with Leilani, streamlining the in-game economy and ensuring that legacy currencies retain value. Additionally, the game has introduced customizable Pack Run controls and new cosmetic options, such as the toggleable Glitter Animal Potion effect, further enhancing the sense of personalization and player agency within the game world.

Additional Noteworthy Features and Quality-of-Life Improvements
Beyond the headline updates, Animal Jam has rolled out several quality-of-life improvements and new features aimed at enriching the player experience. These include:

Security Station: An educational hub for learning about account safety and best practices.

Super Box: A new item or feature (details pending) that promises to add another layer of excitement to gameplay.

Mythical Rewishing: Potentially a feature related to re-rolling or customizing Mythical Pets, adding more flexibility for collectors.

Advanced Den Decorating and Fit Check: Guides and tools to help players personalize their dens and avatars with greater ease and creativity.

Phantom Dungeons and Seasonal Events: New areas and events, such as Phantom Dungeons in the Dungeon Cavern and seasonal trick-or-treating, continue to provide fresh content and replayability for all players.

Conclusion
Animal Jam‚Äôs ongoing updates in 2025 reflect a dynamic and responsive development approach, with a clear focus on expanding gameplay, refining in-game economies, and maintaining a safe, engaging environment for players. The adjustments to Sapphires, Gems, and membership pricing are significant, aiming to balance sustainability for the developers with value for the community. The introduction of Wishing Coins and related features further diversifies the game‚Äôs reward systems and collectible opportunities. As Animal Jam continues to evolve, players can look forward to a steady stream of new content, features, and improvements that keep the world of Jamaa vibrant and exciting.
